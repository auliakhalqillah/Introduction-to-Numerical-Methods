Introduction to Numerical Methods
=================================

Numerical methods are mathematical approaches that have been widely used in science and engineering to solve mathematical problems. In this note, you will find an explanation of number numerical methods and their implementation by using Python programming language. Most of them are related to geophysics or earthquake science context as the application to real problems. The explanation tries to be served as simply as possible and more technically, of course, it should be accompanied by the fundamental concept. Please enjoy the note ðŸ˜„
