Introduction to Numerical Methods
=================================

This is a note for numerical methods. Numerical methods are mathematical approaches that have been widely used in science and engineering to solve mathematical problems. In this note, you will find an explanation of number numerical methods and their implementation by using Python programming language. The explanation tries to be served as simply as possible and more technically, of course, it should be accompanied by the fundamental concept. Please enjoy the note ðŸ˜„
